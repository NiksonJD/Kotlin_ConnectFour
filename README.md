This is the Connect Four project I made myself.

<p>Connect Four is a fun game for two players. The players place discs on a vertical board that is 7 columns wide and 6 rows tall. The goal of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four discs. In this project, you will develop this game with a number of improvements.

<b>Learning outcomes</b><br>
This project will help you understand how to use basic Kotlin components: data structures, conditions and loops. You'll learn how to interface with a program and develop a fun game to play.</p><br/><br/>Learn more at <a href="https://hyperskill.org/projects/202?utm_source=ide&utm_medium=ide&utm_campaign=ide&utm_content=project-card">https://hyperskill.org/projects/202</a>
